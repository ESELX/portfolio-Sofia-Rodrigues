								<p> My name is Sofia, I'm 20 years old and I'm from Aveiro. I grew up in the city of Guimarães and for the moment I find myself taking a degree in Visual Arts and Technologies at Escola Superior de Educação de Lisboa. I decided to do so with the intent of continuing further improve and explore my drawing technique, so that later I could taking a tattooist course.</p>
								<p>This course has been good for gaining knowledge in new areas such as painting, graphic design, photography, etc ... I have never worked in these areas before, but now I have been allowed that due to the course's widespread reach. It was almost in the last year of the degree that I have newly discovered a great interest in areas such as painting and plastic arts. I'm hoping to continue working in these areas.</p>
